# AR Solar System

Welcome to the AR Solar System project! This repository contains the files for an augmented reality (AR) experience built using Unity. The app allows users to explore and interact with the solar system in 3D, providing a unique and immersive learning experience.

## Features

- **Augmented Reality (AR)**: Use AR to visualize the solar system in real-world environments.
- **Interactive Solar System**: Explore planets, moons, and the sun in a 3D environment.
- **Educational**: Learn about the planets, their sizes, positions, and other astronomical facts.
- **Unity-Based**: Built with Unity, a powerful game development engine, ensuring smooth performance and scalability.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- **Unity**: You need Unity to open and run the project. It is recommended to use the version specified in the `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` file for compatibility.
  - Download Unity from [Unity's official website](https://unity.com/).
  
- **AR Foundation**: The project uses Unity's AR Foundation to handle AR functionality. Ensure that you have the necessary AR packages installed via Unity's Package Manager.

- **Android/iOS**: This app is designed to work on both Android and iOS devices. Ensure you have the respective build setups ready for Android Studio or Xcode.

### Installing

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:
   - Clone the repository using Git:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AR-Solar-System.git
     ```

   - Alternatively, you can download the project as a `.zip` file by clicking the "Code" button and selecting "Download ZIP".

2. **Open in Unity**:
   - Open Unity Hub and select "Open Project".
   - Navigate to the folder where you downloaded or cloned the repository and select the project.

3. **Setup AR**:
   - If you haven't done so already, go to Unity's **Package Manager** and install **AR Foundation** and **ARCore XR Plugin** (for Android) or **ARKit XR Plugin** (for iOS).
   - Make sure to configure your project's player settings for AR by enabling AR support.

4. **Build Settings**:
   - For Android: Ensure you have the Android build module installed in Unity.
   - For iOS: Ensure you have the iOS build module installed and configured for Xcode.
   
5. **Deploy the App**:
   - Once everything is set up, you can build and run the app on your device directly from Unity. 

### Usage

1. Open the app on your mobile device.
2. Point the device camera at a flat surface to activate the AR view.
3. Explore the solar system by interacting with the 3D models of the planets and other celestial bodies.
4. Tap on a planet to get more information about it, such as its size, distance from the sun, and other interesting facts.
